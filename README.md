# Summary
Natural human speech to python code; aka talk and it writes python for you.  This shouldn't require deep knowledge of Python itself, but simple ask for tasks and define objectives, things you want it to do, and it will write functions/classes to accomplish said task.

First steps are simple text to simple functions, and from there the aim is to build full scale applications from nothing but the spoken word.

1- Speech to Text
https://github.com/Naki21/google-speech-to-text

2- NLP (Text processing)
https://www.nltk.org/

3- Write python based upon the interpreted "meaning"
That's where this project begins.

# Current
1- Uses basic menus which provide navigation through features and basic create/edit/delete functionality

2- Settings are controlled in the main menu

3- Menu navigation is pretty basic

# Future
1- Train a neural network to improve usability of speech to python

2- More conversational interaction

3- Always listening input with a trainable keyword for having it listen

4- Parallelism/multi-threading via asyncio
